# optimal-transport

Supervisor: Frédéric Nataf

Description: The optimal transport problem was mathematized by the mathematician Gaspard Monge in the 18th century. It consists of finding the optimal way to move sand from excavations to predetermined embankments. In our project, we study the application of optimal transport to images.

The content of the project is to introduce the methods and applications of optimal transport:
- Problem formulations
- Solution by a linear programming algorithm
- Applications to image processing

Useful math concepts:
- Optimization
- Linear Programming

Programming Language: Python
